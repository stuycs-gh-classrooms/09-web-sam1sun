      <h4>Note from the author:</h4>
      <p>
        Orienteering is a competitive navigation-based sport. I've done orienteering since I was 9, and recently I began doing it more competitively as an actual sport. Sadly, orienteering isn't too popular in the United States, and so I often do what I can to raise awareness. Earlier this year, I made an orienteering team at Stuy: <a href="https://stuyactivities.org/orienteers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StuyOrienteers</a>. I go to almost all local events in the NYC area, and try to go to as many NRE (Nationally Ranking Events) as I can. I think orienteering is a wonderful sport and I will continue doing it and trying to get better at it.
