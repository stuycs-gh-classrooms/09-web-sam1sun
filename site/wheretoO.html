        <li>Orienteering is generally done in parks or other nature areas, though some types of orienteering, such as sprint-orienteering, are done in areas such as university campuses. In the NYC area, there is a lot of orienteering in various NYC parks, such as Marine Park, Prospect Park, Van Cortlandt Park, Inwood Hill Park, and others. There are also often events not too far from NYC in New Jersey. There are NREs (Nationally Ranking Events) which allow a competitor to be ranked on the national leaderboard, and occur all over the country.</li>
        <li>Orienteering happens in a range of outdoor spots, like forests, parks, and even urban areas. These places offer different challenges, from navigating through thick woods to crossing streams and climbing hills. Courses are designed to use the natural features, mixing easy trails with trickier sections.</li>
